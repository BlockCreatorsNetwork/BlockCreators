# BlockCreators

An **community for decentralized validators** which follow a shared ethos for validating on blockchains. This ethos is decided via community on-chain proposals. 
To start the process of being accepted into this network as a validator you must submit a proposal including details of your setup, a template can be found below.

# Following an Ethos

Most blockchains are currently centralized. This is not just unfortunate, it goes against the first principle of a dencentalized system... to be trustless.
Most validators are hosted primarily on AWS and other centralized providers, mostly for good intentioned reasons such as:

**Uptime**

Amazon EC2/RDS instances have an uptime guarantee of around 99.95% on a monthly basis. This is hard to beat. So when a delegator sees that their validator can avoid downtime slashing they think "hey, great I won't lose any potential rewards!" when in fact downtime slashing on a network like Cosmos is pretty unlikely as long as you have some redundancy measures in place. If a validator does not sign a block within 10,000 blocks (which equates to about half a day to a day of consecutive downtime), any stake bonded to validator is slashed and the validator is "jailed" for 10 minutes - 0.01% stake slash. 

**Support**

Some of these service providers are billion dollar companies. This means they can afford to pay to have 24/7 support and amazing documentation. It also means integrating your validator with their system is as easy as running a few lines of code. This brings down the barrier of entry to aspiring validators, which is great. The issue however, is that over time these companies tend to become a monoculture, which makes migrating elsewhere a pain in the butt.

**Cost**

Starting off as a validator can be quite expensive, depending on the amount of chains you validate for, and their specific hardware requirements.
Thankfully new alternatives are starting to emerge, such as Akash that could bring the price down exponentially.

# Storytime

Blockchain was created with the intention of removing the requirement of trust. Too many times throughout history have centralized systems that started with good intentions been corrupted and consumed by special interests.

# The Plan

The BlockCreators network will be built using the **Cosmos SDK framework**. 
A generalized framework that simplifies the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint BFT. 
It is based on two major principles: Modularity & capabilities-based security.
Agreement on the network is reached via **Tendermint BFT consensus**.

Tendermint BFT is a solution that packages the networking and consensus layers of a blockchain into a generic engine, 
allowing developers to focus on application development as opposed to the complex underlying protocol. 
As a result, Tendermint saves hundreds of hours of development time.

# Network Information

For the first validator to join the network, they must submit a proposal (template below).
If accepted by me then they will become the first validator and will have to judge subsiquent validator requests.
As each new validator joins the network the voting power is divided equally. A majority vote is needed to pass proposals.

**Benefits to Membership**

As a valiator on the network the main benefit is having a community of decentralized validators behind you to share support, documentation and guidance in your dencentalized validation endevours. You will play a part in building a safer future for blockchain technology and should the public agree, earn more delegations as people migrate from centralized valiators to the latter. You could also add the [DECENTRALIZED] tag to the end of your validator name so people will know you share the same belief system! ✅

Validator Request Template TBA
